# Q1 Project: Weather Finder App

## Description

The [Weather Finder App](http://weather-finder.surge.sh/#!) provides a 5-day weather snapshot forecast for cities all around the world using the Open Weather API to retrieve 5-day forecast data based on city name (e.g. San Diego), city/country (e.g. Dublin, Ireland), or city/state in the case of the US (e.g. Richmond, Virginia).  Once the user hits the "Get Weather" button, a fetch request is submitted to the Open Weather API that retrieves 5-day weather forecast data.  This request is parsed and populates a modal that provides a weather snapshot of the most recent current weather data for temperature and weather conditions, as well as predictions for the same time of day as forecasted by Open Weather's global weather models.  That's why it's called a "weather snapshot."

## Technology

The Weather Finder App was built using jQuery, the Open Weather API, Materialize CSS Framework, and the Brunch Build Tool to organize code in modules.
