# Q1 Project: Weather Finder

## Description

The Weather Finder provides a 5-day weather snapshot forecast for cities all around the world using the Open Weather API to retrieve a 5-day forecast based on city name (e.g. San Diego), city/country (e.g. Dublin, Ireland), or city/state in the case of the US (e.g. Richmond, Virginia).  Once the user hits the "Get Weather" button, a fetch request is submitted to the Open Weather API that retrieves 5-day weather forecast.  The request is parsed and populates a modal that provides a weather snapshot of the most temperature and weather condition data, as well as predictions for the following four days.

## Technology

The Weather Finder App was built using jQuery, the Open Weather API, Materialize CSS Framework, and the Brunch Build Tool to organize code in modules.
