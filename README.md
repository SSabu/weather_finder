# Q1 Project: Weather Finder App

## Description

The Weather Finder App provides a 5-day weather snapshot forecast for cities all around the world using the Open Weather API.  Location information may be submitted using city name (e.g. San Diego), city/country (e.g. Dublin, Ireland), or city/state in the case of the US (e.g. Richmond, Virginia or Richmond, VA).  Once the user submits the location by clicking the "Get Weather" button, a fetch request is sent to the Open Weather API to retrieve a 5-day forecast.  The subsequent response is parsed, the data is massaged and used to populate a modal that provides a weather snapshot of the most recent temperature and weather conditions, as well as temperature and weather conditions for the next four days as forecasted by Open Weather's global weather models.

## Technology

The Weather Finder App was built using jQuery, the Open Weather API, Materialize CSS Framework, and the Brunch Build Tool to organize code in modules.
